        info:
          "According to Northstar Meetings Group a carefully crafted employee benefits package can surpass salary in terms of importance to the employees where some perks may be valued 10 times higher than their cash equivalent. It is important to highlight that many types of benefits are tax deductible (ex. food for employees), this means better benefits is a win-win situation for all parties involved. Companies that nurture and create robust benefits and perks not only see an increase in profits but also a decrease in cost. The 100 Best Companies to Work For since 1998 have seen a 10.6% annual return. According to Harvard Business Review employers show that lost productivity costs are 2.3 times higher than medical and pharmacy costs. A recent study in PeopleKeep highlights that 58% of employees are likely to stay with a company that offers better benefits, which is a value add to all companies. ",
